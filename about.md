I'm a final year undergraduate student pursuing a BSc Computer Science from the University of Hertfordshire. I am a passionate learner, who loves to constantly expand my knowledge through wider reading and solving difficult problems, and I can grasp concepts quickly and with ease. In my free time I read about containers, networks, cryptography, cyber security, distributed ledger technologies and also about programming paradigms.
